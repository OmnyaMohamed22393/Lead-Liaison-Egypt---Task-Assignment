# Infinite Scroll Mock

A small React + TypeScript demo implementing an infinite scroll feed with a mocked backend (MSW) and React Query.

Run:

1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Start dev server: npm run dev

Notes:

Time spent

Approx. 6 hours (estimated) — includes project scaffolding, MSW setup, implementing the infinite scroll feed, search functionality, UI polish, and validation (typecheck/build). Update this field if you prefer a different value.

License / notes

This demo is intentionally small and uses MSW only for local development/testing. Do not serve the worker in production.
